      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> My name is Lydia Minehan-Tubic. My birthday is June 29<sup>th</sup>, 1990. I was born and raised in Seattle. 
          I attended the University of Washington from 2008-2012 and graduated with a BA in environmental studies.  
          During college I was the manager of an ice cream shop, Cold Stone. After I graduated I started working for a company 
          called 3Degrees. I eventually became a part of 3Degrees' partnership team where I assisted utlities in marketing their 
          renewable energy programs. I worked at 3Degrees from 2013-2020.</p>

      <p>In 2016 I received my yoga teaching certification, 200RYT. In 2017 I started teaching yoga classes in studios, 
        and I now teach virtual classes under the pandemic.</p>

      <p>I want to do something more technical which is why I am a student at Code Fellows. 
        I'm excited to start my career in software development this year.</p>

      <p>I love cats, music, festivals, dancing, hula hooping, animal crossing, friends, family, and food! </p>
